 <h2><strong>About Me</strong></h2>
<div align="left">
        <p>I am a computational physicist interested in areas of Complex fluids, Rheology, Biological fluid dynamics, Material characterization, Renewable energy, Complex systems and Multi-scale modeling. For my work in these areas I have used the methods and tools of Linear Algebra, Differential Geometry, Statistics, Machine Learning, and High Performance Computing. I did my PhD work with <a href=https://www.sarkarkausik.com/>Prof. Kausik Sarkar</a> on rheology, diffusion and micro-structural evolution of suspensions of deformable particles such as drops, vesicles, micro-capsules and red blood cells.</p>

        <p>Prior to my PhD work, my experience in research work includes internship at the <a href=https://apm.iitm.ac.in/biomedical/touchlab/index.html>Touch Lab at IIT Madras</a> advised by Prof. Manivannan, where I analyzed the viscoelastic properties of artificial blood vessels to help build a realistic tactile model for IV needle insertion training. I was a summer intern at the <a href=https://mecheng.iisc.ac.in/fmlab/>Force Microscopy lab, IISc</a> advised by Prof. Bobji, where I worked on designing the sample holder and incorporating a force sensor for an in-situ TEM nano-indenter apparatus. I did my Master's work in the Hydro Turbo Machines Lab (HTML), IIT Madras working with <a href=https://mech.iitm.ac.in/meiitm/personnal/dr-dhiman-chatterjee/>Prof. Dhiman Chatterjee.</a> Using computational tools, I designed a novel duct for hydro-kinetic turbines that improved the torque characteristics and the efficiency of the turbine.</p>

        <p>Professionally, I was a junior executive in Operations and Commissioning departments for <a href='https://www.ntpc.co.in/'>NTPC Ltd.</a> and managed commissioning and operation 500MW power plants. In particular, I was part of the commissioning team for VTPS Units 1 and 2. Subsequently, I was part of the Operations team at Ramagundam Super Thermal Power Station, the largest power station in South India as of 2021. During this time I employed machine learning to identify and address process issues such as clinker formation in the furnace. I also developed time-series analysis of the power grid frequency to predict excursions. Later on, I was part of a start-up team (<a href='https://www.linkedin.com/company/aidle/'>Aidle Pvt. Ltd.</a>) that designed and launched a wearable medical alert device in the Indian market.</p>

        <p>I am generally interested in all types of computational methods, computational geometry, physical computing, and hardware and software engineering for electronic devices.</p>
