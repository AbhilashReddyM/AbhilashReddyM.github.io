      <p>I am a computational physicist interested in areas of Complex fluids, Rheology, Biological fluid dynamics,
        Material characterization, Renewable energy, Complex systems and Multi-scale modeling. For my work in these
        areas I have used the methods and tools of Linear Algebra, Differential Geometry, Statistics, Machine Learning,
        and High Performance Computing. I am currently a postdoc working jointly with <a
          href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jcaps">Prof. Jesse Capecelatro</a> and <a
          href="https://bloodflow.engin.umich.edu">Prof. C. Alberto Figueroa</a> at University of Michigan on
        Lagrangian particle models for cardiovascular flows in patient specific geometries.</p>

      <p> I did my PhD work with <a href="https://www.sarkarkausik.com">Prof. Kausik Sarkar</a> on rheology, diffusion
        and micro-structural evolution of suspensions of deformable particles such as drops, vesicles, micro-capsules
        and red blood cells.</p>

      <p>Prior to my PhD work, my experience in research work includes internship at the <a
          href="https://apm.iitm.ac.in/biomedical/touchlab/index.html">Touch Lab at IIT Madras</a> advised by Prof.
        Manivannan, where I analyzed the viscoelastic properties of artificial blood vessels to help build a realistic
        tactile model for IV needle insertion training. I was a summer intern at the <a
          href="https://mecheng.iisc.ac.in/fmlab">Force Microscopy lab, IISc</a> advised by Prof. Bobji, where I worked
        on designing the sample holder and incorporating a force sensor for an in-situ TEM nano-indenter apparatus. I
        did my Master's thesis work in the <a href="https://mech.iitm.ac.in/html/people.php">Hydro Turbo Machines Lab
          (HTML), IIT Madras</a> with <a href="https://mech.iitm.ac.in/meiitm/personnal/dr-dhiman-chatterjee">Prof.
          Dhiman Chatterjee.</a> Using computational tools, I designed a novel duct for vertical-axis cross-flow
        hydro-kinetic turbines that improved the torque characteristics and the efficiency of the turbines.</p>

      <p>While in industry, I was a junior executive in Operations and Commissioning departments for <a
          href="https://www.ntpc.co.in">NTPC Ltd.</a> and managed commissioning and operation of multiple 500MW power
        plants. In particular, I was part of the commissioning team for <a href="http://ntpcntecljv.co.in/">Vellore
          Thermal Power Station (VTPS)</a>. Subsequently, I was part of
        the Operations team at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTPC_Ramagundam">Ramagundam Super Thermal Power
          Station (RSTPS)</a>, the largest power station in South India as of
        2021. During this time I employed machine learning to identify and address process issues such as clinker
        formation in the furnace. I also developed time-series analysis of the power grid frequency to predict
        excursions. Later on, I was part of a start-up (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/aidle/">Aidle
          Pvt. Ltd.</a>) that designed and launched a wearable medical alert device in the Indian market.</p>

      <p>I am generally interested in all types of computational methods, computational geometry, physical computing,
        and hardware and software engineering for electronic devices.</p>
